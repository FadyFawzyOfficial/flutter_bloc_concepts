//* Inside our project, we need to create a spearate test folder (directory) in
//* which we'll have all our test files.
//! A little hint I can give you that every feature of your application needs
//! to be tested in the first place.
//* So the test inside the test folder sould be kind of symmetrical to the
//* features from within your app.
//* So all we have to do is to create the folder symmetrical to the 'lib' folder
//* inside the 'test' folder and add '_test' to the name of the file.
//! counter_cubit.dart -> counter_cubit_test.dart
//* In which wil test out the functionality of our CounterCubit feature.
